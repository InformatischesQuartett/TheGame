There are two important functions which are used by the GameHandler:

> _mediator.GetFromReceivingBuffer()

This returns an KeyValuePair<DataPacket, bool>. The bool is an
indictor if the packet containts server data (currenty, this is
only the case with PlayerSpawn, because then the GameHandler has
to act as the server and it has to create an new SpawningPosition).

> _mediator.AddToSendingBuffer(DataPacket data, bool server)

Same thing the other way round.
