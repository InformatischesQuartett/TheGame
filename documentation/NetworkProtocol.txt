##################################################################

This is the documentation of the network protocol which is used
for The Game. It is based on the protocol used by Minecraft*.

The Lidgren library used in FUSEE communicates via UDP but is able
to ensure (ordered, sequenced or non-sequenced) delivery of any
packet. The packet types KeepAlive, PlayerSpawn and PlayerUpdate
are sent as "reliable and sequenced" which means older packets are
dropped if they arrive after newer packets. To avoid dropping of
packets of different types, different communication channels are
necessary. ObjectSpawn and ObjectUpdate can be sent on the same
channel as they are sent as "realiable and ordered" which means
that they will always arrive in the order they were sent and no
packet will be dropped.

The first byte of every packet identifies the type of the packet.
The length of each packet might be variable because protobuf-net
as the serializer compresses its data as good as possible. Though,
it is not necessary to include the packet length as the variable
fields are always the last few bytes of a packet.

## KEEP ALIVE ####################################################

Packet ID: 0x00
Length:    6 Bytes
Method:	   Reliable, Sequenced
Channel:   0
Direction: Server -> Clients

## UserID         ## int    ## 0 as UserID is the server        ##
## KeepAliveID    ## int    ## 10000000 - 99999999              ##

The server sends a KeepAlive packet with a random ID every 60 sec
to all clients. Every client has to respond within 60 sec with the
same random ID. Otherwise the server disconnects the client.


## PLAYER SPAWN ##################################################

Packet ID: 0x01
Length:    3 - 15 Bytes
Method:	   Reliable, Sequenced
Channel:   1
Direction: Server -> Client

## UserID         ## int    ## A number greater than zero       ##
## Spawn          ## bool   ## false if client just connected   ##
## SpawnPosition  ## float3 ## Coordinates within the 3D space  ##

Whenever a new client connects, the server sends out a PlayerSpawn
packet to the corresponding client. In this case the Spawn field
is false but the client gets its fixed user ID to be identified by
the server.

When the server starts the game or whenever a player dies, the
server sends out a PlayerSpawn packet to all clients or to the
corresponding client. In this case the Spawn field is true. The
client has to set the player to the given coordinates in the
SpawnPosition field.


## PLAYER UPDATE #################################################

Packet ID: 0x02
Length:    7 - 52 Bytes
Method:	   Reliable, Sequenced
Channel:   2
Direction: Client -> Server -> Clients
	   Server -> Clients

## UserID         ## int    ## A number greater than zero       ##
## PlayerActive   ## bool   ## false if player disconnected     ##
## PlayerHealth   ## int    ## A number between 0 and 100       ##
## PlayerPosition ## float3 ## Coordinates within the 3D space  ##
## PlayerRotation ## float3 ## Coordinates within the 3D space  ##
## PlayerVelocity ## float3 ## Vector; Length is speed in px/f  ##

Whenever a player changes the direction or speed of his ship by
pressing a key (respectively by releasing a key) the client sends
a PlayerUpdate packet to the server. The server then updates his
own game state and sends a PlayerUpdate packet to all other
clients.

The PlayerActive field is only used in packets from the server to
the clients. If it is set to fals one client didn't respond to the
last KeepAlive packet. The other clients have to ignore the player
until any new information is available.


## OBJECT SPAWN ##################################################

Packet ID: 0x03
Length:    10 - 55 Bytes
Method:	   Reliable, Ordered
Channel:   3
Direction: Client -> Server -> Clients
           Server -> Client

## UserID         ## int    ## A number greater than zero       ##
## ObjectID       ## uint   ## A number in a specific range     ##
## ObjectType     ## int    ## A number greater than zero       ##
## ObjectPosition ## float3 ## Coordinates within the 3D space  ##
## ObjectRotation ## float3 ## Coordinates within the 3D space  ##
## ObjectVelocity ## float3 ## Vector; Length is speed in px/f  ##

Whenever a player shoots a bullet, the client sends an ObjectSpawn
packet. The server then updates his own game state and sends an
ObjectSpawn packet to all other clients. The UserID field might be
used to identify the bullet's owner when a player is hit.

The ObjectID is based on the UserID. It would be too complicated
to ask the server for an ID everytime a player wants to create a
new object (like a bullet). The formula is simple: 
UserID*16,500,000 <= ObjectID < (UserID+1)*16,500,000

Whenever the server spawns a new object (e.g. power-up) the server
sends an ObjectSpawn packet to all clients. In this case the
UserID field is zero.


## OBJECT UPDATE #################################################

Packet ID: 0x04
Length:    8 Bytes
Method:	   Reliable, Ordered
Channel:   3
Direction: Client -> Server -> Clients
           Server -> Client

## UserID         ## int    ## A number greater than zero       ##
## ObjectID       ## uint   ## A number in a specific range     ##
## ObjectType     ## int    ## A number greater than zero       ##
## ObjectRemoved  ## bool   ## true if the object was removed   ##

This packet is only used to remove objects (bullets, power-ups).
So the ObjectRemoved field is always true.

Whenever a player collects an object (e.g. power-up) the client
sends an ObjectUpdate packet to the server. The server then
updates his own game state and sends a ObjectUpdate packet to all
other clients.

Whenever the server removes an object (e.g. after collision) the
server sends an ObjectUpdate packet to all clients.
